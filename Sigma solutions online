What you should know about short-term loans

If you’re considering a short-term loan, you’ll want to look at all of your options — and the details of all terms — before you commit. Here are a few important things to know to help get you started.
Avoid payday loans

If you need cash fast and have bad credit, you may be tempted by payday loans, which can be very costly. These short-term loans typically are for $500 or less and require repayment on your next payday. Their fees and interest rates can equate to an APR of around 400% — this is much higher than other types of financing, such as a credit card.

A better option may be a payday alternative loan — a kind of short-term loan offered by some federal credit unions. Credit unions won’t charge an application fee of more than $20 for a PAL, and interest rates are capped at 28%.
Compare your options

Shopping around for a short-term personal loan can help save you money and stress down the line. Compare multiple loans before making a final decision. Using an existing credit card may be a better option if it has a lower APR than the short-term loan you’re considering. A personal loan could be a good option to consider if you need to consolidate debt or pay for large expenses.

In each case, make sure you’re borrowing only what you absolutely need and — ideally — what you’re confident you can pay back quickly. If you choose to take out a short-term loan, review your contract carefully to check for potential fees and penalties, such as origination fees, late fees and prepayment fees.
