Why Affirm stands out: If you need to borrow money for a retail purchase, Affirm may be a good alternative to a credit card. The company partners with thousands of online retailers and stores — from furniture stores to auto parts retailers — to offer personal loans for purchases. Rates start as low as 0% APR, though you may pay much more in interest depending on the merchant and your credit.

Affirm typically offers repayment terms of three, six or 12 months. But for small purchases, you may only get one to three months and for large purchases, you may receive up to 48 months.

Down payment may be required — If you’re approved, that doesn’t guarantee you’ll be approved for the full amount you request. In some instances, Affirm may require a down payment.
No-fee promise — Affirm says it doesn’t charge any late fees, annual fees, prepayment fees, or fees to open or close your account.
Prequalification available — Affirm will only perform a soft inquiry at first if you want to check your potential eligibility. But if you formally apply, it’ll do a hard credit inquiry, which can pull your credit scores down a bit. Once you have a loan and start paying it back, Affirm will report your payment history to the credit bureaus. Paying on time may help you gradually strengthen your credit.
