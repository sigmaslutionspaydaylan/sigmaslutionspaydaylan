Why Personify stands out: Personify is an online lender that offers a variety of personal loan amounts and terms, depending on where you live. In Arizona, for example, the company offers loan amounts ranging from $500 to $15,000 and loan terms between twelve months and 48 months. (Keep in mind that the lender may offer different terms on Credit Karma.)

Check where you live to see what may be available. Personify also offers bi-weekly, semimonthly and monthly payment schedule options to help you set a repayment plan that works well for you.

Origination fee — Depending on where you live, Personify may charge an origination fee that it will add to the amount you’re approved to borrow. That means you’ll also be paying interest on this fee.
Other fees — Personify doesn’t charge application fees or prepayment penalty fees for paying off your personal loan earlier than scheduled. But late fees and insufficient funds fees may apply.
Not available in all states — Personify offers personal loans in only 26 states, so you’ll want to check that it operates where you live before you apply.
Application process and requirements — To qualify for a loan, you must complete an online application, have a valid checking account and a source of income. If your application is approved, Personify says you may get your funds as soon as the next business day.
